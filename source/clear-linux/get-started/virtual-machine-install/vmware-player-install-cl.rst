Install Clear Linux as a VMware\* Workstation Player guest OS
#############################################################

`VMware Workstation 14 Player`_ is a type 2 hypervisor which runs on top of 
another operating system such as Windows or Linux. With VMware ESXi, you can 
create, configure, manage, and run |CLOSIA| :abbr:`VMs (Virtual Machine)` on 
your local system. 

This section shows you how to create a new VM and install |CL| into it with 
the VMware Workstation 14 Player hypervisor.  Some of the advantages of 
installing |CL| into a new VM is that it provides you flexibility in configuring, 
for example: its size, the number of partitions, bundles, etc. 
We will perform these steps: 

#.  Install the VMware Workstation Player hypervisor
#.  Download the latest |CL| installer ISO
#.  Verify the integrity of the |CL| image
#.  Uncompress the |CL| image
#.  Create and configure a new VM
#.  Attach the |CL| installer ISO to the VM
#.  Install Clear Linux into the new VM
#.  Detach the |CL| installer ISO from the VM
#.  Power off the VM
#.  Enable EFI boot support
#.  Power on the VM

If you would prefer to use a pre-configured |CL| VMware image instead, 
see :ref:`vmware-player-preconfigured-cl-image`. 

.. note::

  VMware also offers a type 1 hypervisor called `VMware ESXi`_ 
  which is designed for the cloud environment.  For information on how to 
  install |CL| as guest OS on it, see :ref:`vmware-esxi-install-cl`.

.. note::

  The figures shown throughout this document are from the Windows\* version of 
  VMware Workstation 14 Player.  The menus and prompts in these figures are 
  similar as those for the Linux version with some minor wording differences.

Install the VMware Workstation Player hypervisor
************************************************

#.  Enable `Intel速 Virtualization Technology`_ (Intel速 VT) and 
    `Intel速 Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O`_ (Intel速 VT-d) in your
    system's BIOS.

    your preferred version.
#.  Depending on which OS you're running, install it by following one of these
    instructions:

    * For Linux distros supported by VMware: 

      #.  Enable a GUI desktop.  
      #.  Start a terminal emulator.
      #.  Start the installer by issuing the command below and follow the 
          guided steps.

          .. code-block:: console

          Figure 7: VMware Workstation 14 Player - Set memory size

        .. note:: 

          The |CL| installer ISO needs a minimum of 2GB of RAM to work properly.
          After the installation is complete, |CL| can function on as little as 
          128MB of RAM. Thus, you can reduce the memory size if needed.  
          See :ref:`system-requirements` for more details.  

    #.  Under the :guilabel:`Device` list, select :guilabel:`Processors`. 
        See Figure 8.

Enable UEFI boot support
************************

|CL| needs UEFI support in order to boot. You can enable it by appending the 
following to the end of your VM's :file:`.vmx` file:

  .. code-block:: console

    firmware = "efi"

VMware VM files are typically located in:

  * Linux distros: `/home/username/vmware`
  * Windows: `C:/\Users/\username/\Documents/\Virtual Machines` (The file type 
    is `VMware virtual machine configuration`.)

Power on the VM
***************

After configuring the settings above, power on your |CL| virtual machine.

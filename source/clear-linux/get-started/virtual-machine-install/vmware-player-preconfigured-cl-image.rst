Run pre-configured Clear Linux image as a VMware\* Workstation Player guest OS
##############################################################################

`VMware Workstation 14 Player`_ is a type 2 hypervisor which runs on top of 
another operating system such as Windows or Linux. With VMware ESXi, you can 
create, configure, manage, and run |CLOSIA| :abbr:`VMs (Virtual Machine)` on 
your local system. 

This section shows you how to deploy a pre-configured |CL| VMware image on 
VMware Workstation 14 Player using these steps:
  
#.  Install the VMware Workstation Player hypervisor
#.  Download the latest |CL| VMware image
#.  Verify the integrity of the |CL| image
#.  Uncompress the |CL| image
#.  Create and configure a new VM
#.  Attach the pre-configured VMware |CL| image
#.  Enable EFI boot support
#.  Power on the VM

.. note::

  The figures shown throughout this document are from the Windows\* version of 
  VMware Workstation 14 Player.  The menus and prompts in these figures are 
  similar as those for the Linux version with some minor wording differences.

************************************************

#.  Enable `Intel速 Virtualization Technology`_ (Intel速 VT) and 
    `Intel速 Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O`_ (Intel速 VT-d) in your
    system's BIOS.
#.  `VMware Workstation 14 Player`_ is available for Windows and Linux.  Download 
    your preferred version.
#.  Depending on which OS you're running, install it by following one of these
    instructions:

    * For Linux distros supported by VMware: 

      #.  Enable a GUI desktop.  
      #.  Start a terminal emulator.
      #.  Start the installer by issuing the command below and follow the 
          guided steps.

          .. code-block:: console

Enable UEFI boot support
************************

|CL| needs UEFI support in order to boot. You can enable it by appending the 
following to the end of your VM's :file:`.vmx` file:

  .. code-block:: console

    firmware = "efi"

VMware VM files are typically located in:

  * Linux distros: `/home/username/vmware`
  * Windows: `C:/\Users/\username/\Documents/\Virtual Machines` (The file type 
    is `VMware virtual machine configuration`.)

Power on the VM
***************

After configuring the settings above, power on your |CL| virtual machine.
